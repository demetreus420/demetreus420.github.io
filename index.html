        <h3>C language</h3>
        C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting
        structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C
        provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found lasting use in
        applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various
        application software for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.

        <h3>HTML5</h3>
        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a
        web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
        such as JavaScript.
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
        the appearance of the document.

        <h3>CSS3</h3>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
        written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside
        HTML and JavaScript.

        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
        This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification
        of presentation characteristics.

        <h3>C language expirience</h3>

        For ten months I have been studying the C language and masterd it on good level like a junior. During my
        training, I wrote standard library by myself for
        working with numbers and strings and memory and then I did my implementation of Bash commands and a
        shell, and
        desktop chat applictaion was done by me with help from couple of my comrades. During this time I get how to
        work with memory and
        different types of variables. I've introduced myself in data structures and algorithms. Furthermore I've found
        out how to work with data base in C language and how to programm graphic interface in GTK+.

        <h3>HTML expirience</h3>
        For several weeks I have been studying html and for a couple of months I have been constantly practicing using
        it. I learned how to write page markup, how to work with forms and images, and I also learned how to write
        this using semantic tags.

        <h3>CSS expirience</h3>

        During my graduation in ucode I've learned how to write a css styles and use it with html markup, how to make
        a flexible web pages with
        flexboxes and grid. Furthermore I've got how to do css animations and transformations and how to work with
        svg and how to name it and use it all in BEM methodology.

        At the moment I do not have enough knowledge to call myself a front-end developer, but every day I improve my
        skills and study this direction and soon I will achieve that I will be hired.
